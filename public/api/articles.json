Divider This moon will coincide with other celestial events, including the Leonid meteor shower and the Pleiades star cluster. Divider A supermoon is defined as an astronomical phenomenon where a full moon looks larger and brighter than usual. It happens when the full moon occurs at the same time when it is closest to the Earth in its orbit. Divider The term “supermoon” was coined by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979 to describe a full moon that occurs when the moon is “within 90 percent of its closest to Earth”. Divider At the opposite end of the moon sighting spectrum is the micromoon – when the full moon looks especially small and dull because it coincides with the point in the moon’s orbit when it is farthest from the Earth.

Divider “With the termination of the merger agreement, we are now focusing on the future of Capri and our three iconic luxury houses,” Capri CEO John Idol said in a statement. “Looking ahead, I remain confident in Capri’s long-term growth potential for numerous reasons.” Divider The $8.5 billion acquisition, originally announced in August 2023, would have married America’s two largest luxury houses and put six fashion brands under one company: Tapestry’s Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman with Capri’s Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors.
